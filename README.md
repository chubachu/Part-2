<p>This program follows an events schedule to create template-based emails and loads them into VerticalResponse, an email service provider.  There are 3 event types, each having their own email templates for 'first sends' (3 weeks out) and 'resends' (1 week out).  The program can determine which emails need to be created based on today's date.  It also logs the emails created and populates a CSV file used to create distribution lists.  I'm proud of this program because it saves my team hours of work every week.  While the functions it performs are fairly simple, the fact that it compiles quickly and scales easily make it invaluable.  As one of my first Ruby programs, it was enlightening learning how a few lines of code can add so much value.<p>
